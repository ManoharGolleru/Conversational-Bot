## Introduction to Action Sequences
Our goal is to guide large language models toward responses that are both relevant and contextually appropriate. To do this, we developed a catalog of conversational action sequences that reflect how people naturally structure their interactions.
We began by compiling two separate inventories. The first drew on everyday conversations, listing common patterns such as greetings, questions and answers, requests, and farewells. The second list was grounded in Conversation Analysis, capturing well-studied adjacency pairs and multi-move sequences from the academic literature.
By carefully merging these two sources, we produced a unified taxonomy of 37 distinct action sequences.

**We now wanted to group the sequences into some overarching categories**


## Overarching categories 

1. **Opening/Closing Rituals**  
   Rituals that frame a conversation.  
   _Examples:_ “Hello,” “Who’s there?”, “Bye.”

2. **Information Exchange**  
   Moves that share or confirm content.  
   _Examples:_ Asking and answering questions, making announcements, telling stories.

3. **Action Coordination**  
   Moves that accomplish tasks.  
   _Examples:_ Making requests, offering help, asking permission, setting reminders, negotiating.

4. **Interpersonal Alignment**  
   Moves that manage social relationships.  
   _Examples:_ Apologizing, giving compliments, expressing empathy, voicing complaints.

5. **Discourse Management**  
   Moves that keep the interaction on track.  
   _Examples:_ Requesting clarification, interrupting, correcting misunderstandings, shifting topics.

6. **Self-Revelation**  
   Moves where speakers share personal information.  
   _Examples:_ Claiming an identity (“As a parent…”), making personal disclosures.

## Current Testing Efforts

We’ve applied all three sequence catalogs to GPT-4o to generate model responses. While we haven’t yet performed a formal evaluation, our experiments include:

1. **Random Prompt Sampling**  
   Generated N distinct “first-pair” prompts at random and produced responses guided by the action-sequence framework.

2. **Targeted Sequence Prompts**  
   Crafted prompts designed to trigger specific sequences and generated the corresponding candidate replies.

3. **Metric Collection**  
   For each generated response, we log:
   - **prompt**  
   - **prompt_sequence** (the sequence the model assigned to the prompt)  
   - **suitable_sequences** (the set of sequences allowable for that prompt)  
   - **response_text**  
   - **sequence_name** (the sequence the model used in its reply)  
   - **model**  
   - **tokens_used**  
   - **latency_s**

## Publication Plan
----
1. **Introduction**  
   - Motivation: controlling LLM outputs via dialog‐act/action‐sequence prompts  
   - Gap: most personas/prompt templates ignore conversational structure  
   - Contributions:
     1. A unified 37‐item action‐sequence taxonomy grounded in CA & everyday practice  
     2. Prompt‐engineering approach to classify a user turn & constrain LLM replies  
     3. Empirical evaluation of sequence classification & response quality  

2. **Related Work**  
   - Dialogue Acts & Conversation Analysis (Sacks et al., 1974; Schegloff, 2007)  
   - Prompt Engineering for LLM control  
   - LLM evaluation frameworks -Dialogue State Tracking (DSTC)  

3. **Methodology**  
   - **Sequence Taxonomy**: how we merged the two original catalogs into 37 items, with CA references  
   - **Prompt Design**: system-prompt schema, JSON spec, annotation conventions  
   - **Model Setup**: GPT-4o zero-shot; fine-tuned smaller model (if possible)

4. **Experiments**  
   - **Data**: how we collected/annotated test prompts (random vs. targeted sequence prompts)  
   - **Metrics**: classification accuracy, human Likert ratings, latency  
   - **Baselines**: Base LLM, off-the-shelf smaller model, fine-tuned model  

5. **Results**  
   - Table/Figure: prompt_sequence accuracy across models  
   - Table: human quality ratings vs. sequence adherence  
   - Figure: latency vs. quality trade-off curve  

6. **Discussion**  
   - Which sequences are hardest to classify or generate?  
   - When does fine-tuning help vs. prompt design?  
   - Limitations: annotation noise, domain coverage  

7. **Conclusion & Future Work**  
   - Summarize effectiveness of sequence-driven prompting  
   - Next: adaptive prompting, multi-turn planning, System Integration

## Testing Plan Going Forward

1. **Pilot Study Setup**  
   - **Select a subset of sequences** (e.g. 5–7 from the unified list).  
   - **Annotate** a modest set (e.g. 100) of “first-pair” prompts with:  
     - **prompt_sequence** (the correct sequence for that prompt)  
     - **suitable_sequences** (the set of valid follow-up moves)

2. **Stage 1: GPT-4o Evaluation**  
   - **Classification Test**: Feed each prompt to GPT-4o and record its predicted `prompt_sequence`.  
   - **Response Generation**: Ask GPT-4o to produce candidate replies for each `suitable_sequence`.  
   - **Metrics**:  
     - **Sequence Accuracy**: % of prompts correctly classified.  
     - **Response Coverage**: Did GPT-4o generate one reply per suitable sequence?  
     - **Latency**: End-to-end time per turn.

3. **Stage 2: Baseline Comparison**  
   - **Base LLM**: Repeat the above with a vanilla LLM prompt (“Just answer:” + prompt).  
   - **Sequence-Prompted LLM**: Use your action-sequence system prompt ("System prompt:" + prompt).  
   - **Compare**:  
     - **Response Quality** (human ratings of relevance & diversity)  
     - **Sequence Adherence** (does each reply fit its annotated sequence?)  
     - **Efficiency** (tokens & latency)
       
4. **Iteration & Scaling**  
   - Analyze pilot results to identify:  
     - Which sequences are hardest to classify or generate?  
     - Whether the prompt format needs tweaking.  
   - **Refine** taxonomy, prompt wording, or annotation guidelines.  
   - **Expand** to more sequences and a larger annotated set once the workflow is stable.

5. **Next Steps**  
   - Full study with all 37 sequences.  
   - Incorporate multi-turn dialogues to test consistency.  
   - Prepare for human evaluation (Likert scales, inter-rater agreement).
